No we will not let you go, let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go, let him go\nBismillah! We will not let you go, let me go\nWill not let you go, let me go (never)\nNever, never, never, never, never let me go\nNo, no, no, no, no, no, no\nOh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go\nBeelzebub has a devil put aside for me\nFor me\nFor me\n\nSo you think you can stop me and spit in my eye\nSo you think you can love me and leave me to die\nOh, baby, can't do this to me, baby\nJust gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here\n\nOoh yeah, ooh yeah\n\nNothing really matters\nAnyone can see\nNothing really matters nothing really matters to me\n\nAnyway the wind blows",
